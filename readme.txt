Quadros Alpha is a memory game that once you start playing, it will show you a solution. That solution will disappear after a second and you will need to duplicate that solution on the game board. If you complete the level, you will be presented with a toast and proceed to the next level. If you do not complete the level, it will show you the solution and ask if you would like to retry. On the Game Board, you have 4 lives, equal to 4 possible mistakes you can make. A score system for each correct guess is presented. Two buttons are also available on the game, Reset and Quit, these will supply a confirmation request.
